- An example paper of Hi-C and TADs and linked data

Question remain:
- Hi-C seems like to be a special kind of sequencing involving digestion. So need to be careful when selecting the single-cell dataset for the final project.
- Need to decide a species. Could be human or Mouse (TAD boundaries conserve between species.)
    - from there, we will need to contact the post-doc in Leonord's lab for the isolation scores, which will be used as a proxy for TADs boundaries.
